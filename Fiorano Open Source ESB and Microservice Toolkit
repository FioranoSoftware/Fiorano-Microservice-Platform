Fiorano Open Source microservice container is built on top of industry standards including OSGi (Apache Karaf) and JMS (Apache ActiveMQ).

Fiorano's Open Source wire level protocol called Component (Microservice) Control Protocol (CCP) allows asynchronous communication between the Open Source ESB server and the microservices. 

**Note:** CCP is used by the microservices to communicate with server for commands like fetch configuration, initiate shutdown, set log level.

| Communication | Runtime Deployment | Monitoring |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Deployed Microservices communicate asynchronously using JMS |  - Automatically creates the JMS endpoints (i.e. message queues, Topics) for individual Microservices <br> - Also creates “routes” for communication </br> | - Includes tools and APIs for managing and monitoring Microservices <br>- Ability to debug and modify message flows between Microservices</br> |
