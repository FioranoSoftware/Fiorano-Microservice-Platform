###Writing Guidelines###
Please follow these guidelines:
* Use simple words, and frame crisp and clear sentences 
* Use Active Voice; use Passive Voice sparingly
* Start with a Caital letter and end with a period (full stop).
* Expand/explain an abbreviation/jargon in its first occurance
* Rephrase ambiguous sentences, for example,  
  - avoid using the third person like 'it' and 'this.'  
  - replace words like 'appropriately' with a proper explanation
  - give more examples to replace 'etc'  
* Use *Bold* formatting to represent buttons
* Omit 'on' in 'Click on' a button. 
* While referring to UI names, use the words as it is; Title case is apt for UI elements unless it is a long sentence.
* Use italics for a jargon, and use single quotes (for a word or two) and double quotes (for a sentence) to mark emphasis.
* Provide codes in writing (type the text) than attaching image/screenshot unless it refers to something specific.
* Use monospaced fonts to represent codes/scripts, ideally Courrier New.
* Review and revise/edit before saving
