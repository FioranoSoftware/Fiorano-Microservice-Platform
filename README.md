##Welcome to Fiorano OpenESB##

Fiorano OpenESB enables application integration by choreographing Microservices into asynchronous flows via the Fiorano Studio and associated tools. The Component Control Protocol (CCP), a wire-level protocol, allows the asynchronous communication between the Open ESB server and micro services being choreographed/orchestrated into application flows. The transport is pluggable and any available JMS engine may be used such as Apache ActiveMQ, JBOSS, TIBCO, IBM, RabbitMQ and FioranoMQ.

Fiorano OpenESB is bundled with a Microservices toolkit that enables the development of JMS-compliant Microservices in a number of supported languages including Java, C, C++ and C#.  
See [Fiorano Microservices Tookit](https://github.com/FioranoSoftware/Fiorano-Microservice-Toolkit) for more info regarding the microservices.
